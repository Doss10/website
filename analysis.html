			<td class = "lc">
				<ul>
					<li><p>Reason 1: Solid baseline</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The website has all the necessary information. </li>
							<li>It does a good job of communicating with the viewer in a straightforward way.</li> 
							<li>We should make sure to preserve all this info especially the food advisory and other legal stuff.</li>
							<li>The current website also highlights Fork In The Road’s signature dish “Crack-a-roni” which we should keep.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>Reason 2: Quality product</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The food at the restaurant is actually really good!</li>
							<li>By including customer reviews and social media links we will emphasise the food quality from real world community members.</li>
							<li>The yelp page includes a long description of how the restaurant prioritizes quality local ingredients, but this information is nowhere to be found on the website! We will add this information to the about section which will improve the restaurant's brand overall.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>Reason 3: Kind staff and community engagement</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Many yelp reviews mention the friendly staff. We will emphasise this aspect though reviews.</li>
							<li>There is no sense of community on the current website, but the community is clearly already there! All we have to do is convey that to the customers. Via the about page, reviews page, and social media links.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td class = "lc">
				<ul>
					<li><p>Reason 1: SEO:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Facebook and yelp come up before the website does!</li>
							<li>If we want to control our brand narrative we need to optimize the website so when somebody looks up “fork in the road” it is higher on the list of results.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>Reason 2 : Branding</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Current website lacks clear branding. We will need to identify a brand and incorporate it consistently throughout the site.</li>
							<li>Key part is highlighting the product and quality of service through plentiful information about recipes, company values, and service.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>Reason 3: Social Media Presence</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Business lacks any avenue to social media presence. This application can facilitate these avenues for the customer with links to said pages. </li>
							<li>Customers can reach the business with social media by way of review, contact with management, etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>Reason 4: Website Layout	</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Website layout and navigation is poor. The flow is unorganized and information is laid out with no clear plan or style.</li>
							<li>Improvements would be a clear pathway and navigation structure including a scrolling feature.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

			<td class = "lc">
				<ul>
					<li><p>Reason 1: Escape</p>
						<ul>
							<li>People want to get away from the grim realities of covid life</li>
							<li>Offer a website that feels homey and serves as an entry point for the larger community associated with the restaurant</li>
							<li>By improving the overall consistency and meaningfulness of the brand we will attract customers looking for comfort (especially comfort food!)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>Reason 2: Health benefits</p>
						<ul>
							<li>People want to prioritize their health and the health of the planet</li>
							<li>We already have good quality food and prioritize finding local ingredients, so we just need to let people know this is something we’re focusing on</li>
							<li>We have some more comfort-food options and some more healthy options. We can emphasize the healthy options on our website to appeal to people who are trying to eat healthy.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>Reason 3: Small business</p>
						<ul>
							<li>People want to shop smal</li>
							<li>We can make the website more representative of the restaurant’s style and vibe</li>
							<li>We can also include photos from instagram and other social media people have taken at our restaurant on our website as a spotlight to emphasize the sense of community and insta-worthiness of the restaurant.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			<td class = "lc">
				<ul>
					<li><p>Reason 1: Competition</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Other businesses opening up locally.</li>
							<li>Ensuring that loyal customers stay loyal by showing appreciation for them. Ways we can do this are offers, deals, etc. This can be done on the website but more so through social media.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>Reason 2: Big Brand Competition</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Large chain restaurants in the area can be devastating competition because of their large loyal fanbase and branding.</li>
							<li>We can work on strong branding.</li>
							<li>Quality of service and product is an anchor in this area.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><p>Reason 3: Covid-19</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Customers have less money and numerous other conflicts  because of the pandemic. We can ensure that we maintain a loyal and consistent following through branding and quality.</li>
							<li>This can be facilitated by keeping open communication avenues through our page and social media. </li>
							<li>People can’t eat in the dining room so we can improve the website to make up for this.</li>
						</ul>
